WeatherCurrents is an algorithmic installation art project developed
for the 2016 Currents New Media festival in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
WeatherCurrents draws on various ideas from computer science,
including: A.I., data mining, automata theory, information recognition,
genetic algorithms, and data visualization. This repo is a work
in progress. Contributions toward its goals are greatly appreciated.
Below, are general headers for the active sub-projects/goals.

a) Retrieving and stabilizing real-time weather data.

b) Ambient environments: weathering via automata.

c) Distributed computation: parallelizing.
