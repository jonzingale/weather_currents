Weather Currents is an algorithmic art installation in development
for the 2016 Currents New Media festival in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
Weather Currents draws on various ideas from computer science,
including: A.I., data mining, automata theory, information recognition,
genetic algorithms, and data visualization. This repo is a work
in progress. Contributions toward its goals are greatly appreciated.
