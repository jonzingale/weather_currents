WeatherCurrents is an algorithmic installation art project
developed for the 2016 Currents New Media festival in Santa Fe,
New Mexico. WeatherCurrents draws on various ideas from computer 
science, including: A.I., data mining, automata, information 
recognition, genetic algorithms, and data visualization.

The project has been factored into a collection of sub-goals.
*) Scraping real-time weather data or setting up an api.
*) Designing color-foragers or developing via genetic algorithms.
*) Modifying ambient images via rule and region based automata.
*) Distributing processes via cloud or other services.
