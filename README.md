WeatherCurrents is an algorithmic installation art project intended for the
2016 Currents New Media festival in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The project brings
together various ideas from computer science, including: A.I, data mining,
information recognition, automata, data visualization and genetic algorithms.

The project is factored into a handful of sub-projects.
*) Weather scraping and data visualization.
*) Ambient image modification.
*) Color-foraging via conscious and unconscious (genetic algorithmic) design.
*) Distributed processes via cloud and/or other servers.
