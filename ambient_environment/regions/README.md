##Regions##

<p>
Here we hope to find aesthetically reasonable<br>
methods of defining computational regions for<br>
blinkylights over images. The goal being to have<br>
different rules effect color regions related to<br>
'the sky' versus 'the mountain'.<br><br>

One strategy includes coarsening the color space<br>
by sorting the present colors into fewer effectively<br>
creating a 'bitmap' by which the computational regions<br>
can be simplified.
