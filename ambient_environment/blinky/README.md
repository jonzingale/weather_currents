<p>This directory contains various ideas regarding blinkylight games (cellular automata).<br>
The code is written for 'ruby processing' and as such requires both processing and<br>
jruby (here I am using jruby-1.7.12-complete). Once the ruby processing is running,<br>
an example can be run by simply typing </p>```rp5 run blinky_lights.rb```

Git documentation regarding RubyProcessing can be found here:<br>
https://github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing.<br>


Goals here include:
<ul>
<li>fine tune blinkylights to color regions.</li>
<li>optimize run time of blinkylight games over large images.</li>
<li>explore rule and color spaces for long playing games. </li>
<li>parallelize the run-time execution.</li>
</ul>
