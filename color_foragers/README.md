### Color Foragers ###

weather_currents/color_foragers is a directory<br>for developing color crawlers for the project.

Some ideas to keep in mind include?
<ul>
<li>metrics and ways of measuring performance</li>
<li>neighborhoods and ways of knowing the environment</li>
<li>ways of modifying a space</li>
</ul>

<p>
Within the class_based_foragers directory is a pair of files:<br>
<ul><li>color_crawlers.rb</li><li>color_sampler.rb</li></ul>
The first exhibits a class of color crawlers, the second instantiates the class.</p>

To run the code in rubyProcessing, go do the class_based_foragers directory and
```bash
rp5 run color_sampler.rb
```
