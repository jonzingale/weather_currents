<p>
weather_currents/color_foragers is a directory for developing<br>
color crawlers for the project.
</p>

Some ideas to keep in mind include?
<ul>
<li>metrics and ways of measuring performance</li>
<li>neighborhoods and ways of knowing the environment</li>
<li>ways of modifying a space</li>
</ul>

<p>
Within the class_based_foragers directory is a pair of files:<br>
<ul><li>color_crawlers.rb</li><li>color_sampler.rb</li></ul>
The first exhibits a class of color crawlers, the second instantiates the class.<br>
To run the code in rubyProcessing 
```
rp5 run color_sampler.rb
```
</p>
